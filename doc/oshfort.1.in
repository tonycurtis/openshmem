.SH NAME
\fBoshfort\fP - compile an OpenSHMEM Fortran program
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBoshfort\fP
.RS
.br
[ underlying compiler flags ]
.br
file.f [file.f ...]
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBoshfort\fP is a wrapper in the vein of mpif77 that compiles
an OpenSHMEM program.  The wrapper hides implementation
details from the user.
.SH EXAMPLES
The command
.LP
.RS
$ oshfort -g -o foo.exe foo.f
.RE
.LP
compiles the Fortran source code foo.f into the OpenSHMEM executable foo.exe.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The underlying compiler/linker invoked by this wrapper is determined
when the OpenSHMEM library is built.  To override, set the
.LP
.RS
\f(CROSH_FC\fP
.RE
.LP
environment variable.
.SH NOTES
The OpenSHMEM specification does not say anything about
how OpenSHMEM programs are compiled, linked and launched.
These wrapper programs are supplied as part of the Reference
Library for convenience.
