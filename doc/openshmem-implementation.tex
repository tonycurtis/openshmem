\section{Introduction}

This document is an overview of the implementation strategy for the
initial, reference version of OpenSMHEM. We will discuss the concept
of a partitioned global address space for completeness.

\section{Terminology}

An \openshmem program consists of a number of processors executing
separate processes. A processor is referred to as a ``processing
element'', or PE. All PEs run the same program in the SPMD model,
although they can discover which position, or rank, they occupy within
the program and diverge in behavior.

The number of PEs participating in the program is set at launch-time
(although not all PEs need to do work). PEs are numbered monotonically
increasing from 0 up to $N-1$, where N is the total number of PEs.
PEs are assumed to be equidistant from each other for communication
purposes, no topological information is currently exposed.

Communication occurs through point-to-point one-sided routines,
point-to-point remote atomic operations, and collective operations. A
one-sided operation is a communication in which one PE transfers data
to another PE, but the ``other'' PE does not participate: the data
transfer does not cause the other PE to be interrupted to acknowledge
the transfer (assuming the hardware underneath \openshmem allows this).

\section{Partitioned Global Address Space}

Parallel programs running in a distributed environment access both
local and remote data. The model used to construct the program can
either expose or hide this distribution. Exposed models include that
of MPI and PVM, in which explicit messages are required to pass data
between processors participating in a parallel program. Hidden models
include those with a Global Address Space (GAS), in which there
appears to be memory accessible from all processors. This memory may
be physically accessible, or may in fact be made available through I/O
operations over network interconnects.

SHMEM provides a symmetric view of memory, in which processors
allocate variables in concert but have their own copies. A processor
can then ``put'' or ``get'' data to, or from, other processors by
requesting a specific variable on another processor. SHMEM provides
for address translation when required to allow a variable allocated by
one processor to be accessed by another, because in a number of
environments it is not guaranteed that address spaces are
uniform. This allocation-in-concert of separate variables is termed
Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS).

Clusters that use interconnects with remote direct memory access
(rDMA) are of particular interest to the PGAS community as they
provide hardware off-load capability to avoid interrupts during
one-sided communications.

\section{SHMEM History and \openshmem}

The SHMEM communications library was originally developed as a
proprietary application interface by Cray for their T3D systems and
subsequently the T3E models. These systems typically consisted of a
memory subsystem with a logically shared address space over physically
distributed memories, a memory interconnect network, a set of
processing elements (PEs), a set of input-output gateways, and a host
subsystem. The systems were designed to support latency hiding
mechanisms such as prefetch queues, remote stores and the Block
Transfer Engine (BLT). The prefetch queues allowed the users to issue
multiple asynchronous single-word reads which could overlap with
computation. Remote stores enabled PEs to directly write to other PE's
memory asynchronously, while the BLT could hide latency while
transferring blocks of data efficiently between local memory and
remote memory locations. The explicit shared memory programming method
allowed structured communication via shared memory on Cray MPP
systems.

SHMEM was later adapted by SGI for its products based on the Numa-Link
architecture and included in the Message Passing Toolkit (MPT). Other
SHMEM implementations grew out of the SGI and Cray implementations,
including Quadrics, HP, IBM, gpSHMEM and SiCortex, but diverged from
the original libraries as they developed. These implementations of the
SHMEM API support C, C++, and Fortran programs; however, the
differences between SHMEM implementations' semantics and APIs are
subtle, resulting in portability and correctness
issues. U.S. Department of Defense funded a collaboration between Oak
Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Houston to develop a
specification for a uniform SHMEM API. The \openshmem specification was
announced to address the divergence of the SHMEM APIs.

\section{The Reference \openshmem Library}

The overall structure of the reference library is shown below. We use
an intermediate library such as GASNet or ARMCI to abstract away from
a particular interconnect/platform, although there is nothing to stop
a more direct approach being used. Internally, the reference
implementation of \openshmem provides private APIs for memory
management, the communications layer, tracing/debugging and
(eventually) support for adaptivity to choose things like a barrier
algorithm at run-time.

\section{Implementation Strategy}

In this section we talk about how the reference library was written
and why certain implementation strategies were chosen.

\subsection{GASNet}

GASNet provides access to the symmetric memory areas. A memory
management library marshals accesses to these areas during allocation
and freeing of symmetric variables in user code, usually through a
call like \texttt{shmalloc()} or \texttt{shfree()}.

When you \texttt{gasnet\_attach()} and ask for segment information,
each PE has access to an array of segments, 1 segment per PE. Each PE
initializes a memory pool within its own segment. The set up is
handled either by GASNet internally (``fast''/''large'' model) or by
\openshmem itself (``everything'' model). The table of segments
allows any PE to know the virtual location and size of the segment
belonging to any other PE.

If the platform allows it, GASNet can align all the segments at the
same address, which means that all PEs see the same address for
symmetric variables and there's no address translation.

In the general case though, segments are not aligned (e.g.\ due to a
security measure like process address space randomization by the
OS). However, each PE can see the addresses of the segments of the
other PEs locally, and can therefore do address translation.

Currently alignment is not checked for, so we're coding to the
``worst case scenario''. That just adds a \emph{small} overhead if
the segments are in fact aligned. The library should at some point
introduce code that differentiates between aligned and non-aligned
environments with optimized code for the former case (GASNet provides
a macro you can test against).

\subsubsection{Segment Models}

GASNet supports 3 segment models: ``fast'', ``large'' and
``everything''.  ``fast'' and ``large'' allow a certain region of
process memory to be registered.  ``everything'' maps the entire
process memory, but is not supported by all interconnect conduits, and
often shows very poor performance in the instances where the author
has tried to use it.

For the ``fast'' and ``large'' models, extra support has to be added
to handle communication with global variables, because only the
symmetric heap is exposed by GASNet. Currently this is done via Active
Messages.

For the SMP conduit, PSHM support is required to run parallel threaded
programs with \openshmem. This excludes the ``everything'' model (at
least for the architectures to hand).

\subsection{Initialization}

In \texttt{src/updown/} we handle setting up the \openshmem runtime,
and eventual shutdown. Shutdown is implicit in user code, there is no
call to do this in SGI SHMEM, so we register a handler to be called
when \texttt{main()} exits. (Cray SHMEM has an explicit finalize call,
however, and a profiling interface proposal has suggested introducing
this to \openshmem.) The segment exchange is a target for future
optimization: in large programs, the start-up time will become
burdensome due to the large number of address/size
communications. Strategies for avoiding this include lazy
initialization and hierarchical or directory-based lookups.

\subsection{Incorporating \openshmem into Programs}

For C, the appropriate header file must be included:
\texttt{<shmem.h>}~\footnote{The location \texttt{<mpp/shmem.h} is
  also accepted, but is now considered deprecated and the preprocessor
  can generate a warning if desired}.  The first \openshmem call in
any program must be \texttt{shmem\_init ()}.  The number of PEs is
taken from the invoking environment. Currently this number is assumed
to be fixed throughout the lifetime of the program, but fault
tolerance extensions could generalize this notion. Below are simple C
and Fortran program templates:

\vspace{0.1in}
\begin{minipage}{0.75\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C,caption={Simple C ``hello world'' program}]
#include <stdio.h>
#include <shmem.h>

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int me, npes;

  shmem_init ();
  me   = shmem_my_pe ();       /* which PE I am */
  npes = shmem_n_pes ();     /* how many PEs in program */
  printf("Hello from PE %d of %d\n", me, npes);
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\vspace{0.1in}

\begin{minipage}{0.75\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Fortran,caption={Simple Fortran ``hello world'' program}]
program hello
  include 'shmem.fh'
  integer :: shmem_my_pe, shmem_n_pes
  integer :: me, npes

  call shmem_init()
  me   = shmem_my_pe()
  npes = shmem_n_pes()
  print *, 'Hello from PE ', me, ' of ', npes
end program hello
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Communications Substrate}

The \openshmem library has been written to sit on top of any
communications library that can provide the required
functionality. Initially we have targetted GASNet. The directory
\texttt{src/comms/gasnet} provides implementations of the internal
API. All subsequent references to GASNet should be read with an eye on
the abstraction process.

\subsection{Servicing Communications}

GASNet provides this functionality in some cases. The mainline code
needs to spin on variable waits (e.g.\ shmem\_long\_waituntil) to poll
GASNet, otherwise progress is automatic via a servicer unit.  This is
implemented with a progress thread that polls in a continuous loop.

\subsection{Memory Management}

Initially we tried to use the TLSF library (as used in the SiCortex
SHMEM implementation):

\url{http://rtportal.upv.es/rtmalloc/}

but this proved to have weird interactions with Open-MPI. Tracking
program progress with valgrind

\url{http://www.valgrind.org/}

suggested that system memory calls were
being intercepted.

So, following the Chapel lead,

\url{http://chapel.cray.com/}

we now use the ``dlmalloc'' library

\url{http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html}

to manage allocations in the symmetric memory space.

\subsection{Point-to-point routines}

Point-to-point operations are a thin layer on top of GASNet. The
non-blocking put operations with implicit handles provide a way to
subsequently fence and barrier. However, tracking individual handles
explicitly with a hash table keyed on the address of symmetric
variables may give better performance, and this needs to be looked
into.

The Quadrics extensions that add non-blocking calls into the API
proper have already been requested for the \openshmem development. An
initial attempt at these are already in the library and they pass the
Cray verification tests.

\subsection{Atomic Operations}

Atomic operations include swaps, fetch-and-add and locks (discussed
separately in \ref{sub:Locks}). The first two are handled via GASNet's
Active Messages. Increment was originally layered on top of add
(increment = add 1, after all) but was rewritten with its own
handlers. The payload for increment can be ever so slightly smaller
than for add since there's no need to pass the value to add. In large
applications, even such a small saving could add up (if you'll pardon
the pun).

Earlier versions of the implementation had a single handler lock
variable per operation (one for all adds, one for all increments,
\emph{etc.}).
% However, we've now added a hash table to dynamically
% allocate and manage per-target-address handler locks. Large-scale
% atomic operations, like add-scatters across multiple variables could
% easily benefit from this, as the lock granularity then permits
% concurrent discrete memory accesses.
However, the \openshmem 1.3 specification clarified atomicity
guarantees: there is now a lock per data-type (integer, float, double,
...).

\subsection{\label{sub:Locks}Locks}

\openshmem provides routines to claim, release and test global locks.
These can be used for mutual-exclusion regions. Our implementation is
from the Quadrics library, which is a version of the
Mellor-Crummy-Scott algorithm (``Algorithms for Scalable
Synchronization on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors'' by John
M. Mellor-Crummey and Michael L Scott).  The locks are layered on top
of \openshmem primitives, so there are no Elan dependencies.

\subsection{Barrier and broadcast}

The initial version is naive, making the root of the broadcast a
bottleneck.  This is partly intentional, to allow a student at UH to
explore better algorithms and work out how to demonstrate and document
the improvements. We would like to collect some locality information
inside the library to help decide communication order inside these
algorithms: PEs that differ in rank by large amounts are likely to be
further away topologically too, so by sending to more distant PEs
first, we can stagger the network traffic and balance the latencies
better. A proper measurement of ``distance'' is needed here. ``hwloc''
provides a per-system distance metric in NUMA terms. A simple
extension could e.g.\ just multiply the distance by some constant when
moving off-node to penalize network traffic.

\subsection{Collects}

The directories \texttt{src/fcollect} and \texttt{src/collect}
implement the collector routines (concatenating arrays on a set of PEs
into a target array on all of those PEs).

\begin{description}
\item[fcollect] is pretty easy since all the PEs must contribute the
  same amount of data. This means we can just pre-compute where each PE
  writes to their targets.
\item[collect] is harder because each PE can write different
  amounts. Thought of 2 ways of handling this:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item initial exchange of sizes ``from the left'' so each PE can
    compute its write locations; then same as fcollect
  \item wavefront: PEs wait for notification from PEs before them in the
    set (lower numbered). This passes the offsets across the set.
  \end{enumerate}
  I used \#2. \#1 potentially generates a network storm as all PEs wait
  to work out where to write, then all write at once. \#2 staggers the
  offset notification with a wave of writes moving up the PE numbers.
\end{description}

\subsection{Reductions}

Reductions coalesce data from a number of PEs into either a single
variable or array on all participating PEs. The coalescing involves
some kind of arithmetic or logic operation (e.g.\ sum, product,
exclusive-or).  Currently probably naive, using gets. A version with
puts that can overlap communication and the computation of the
reduction operation should be more scalable. However, the code is
rather compact and all ops use the same template. A future version of
\openshmem may add user-defined reductions, and in fact the framework
for this is already in place: all that is needed is a specification of
the \openshmem API.

\subsection{Address and PE Accessibility}

\openshmem allows us to test whether PEs are currently reachable, and
whether addresses on remote PEs are addressable. GASNet is used to
``ping'' the remote PE and then we wait for an ``ack'' with a
configurable timeout. Remains to be seen how useful this is, and
whether it can be used for future fault tolerance issues.

For now, the implementation simply says ``yes'' to this query, but in
the future we will add some real tests, e.g.\ for fault tolerance.
Some infrastructure is already there for this, but isn't quite doing
what was intended.

\subsection{Tracing Facility}

This library contains \textbf{trace points} with categorized
messages. These are listed in section \ref{sec:Environment-Variables}

A high-resolution clock is maintained to timestamp such messages.
Numerically sorting the output on the first field can thus help
understand the order in which events happened.

\subsection{C++}

The C++ interface is basically the C one. There is one point of
contention, namely complex numbers. The SGI documentation refers only
to the use of C99 ``complex'' modifiers, not to C++'s
\texttt{complex<T>}.  The use of complex number routines (e.g.\
reductions) in C++ is thus not clearly specified.

\subsection{Fortran}

The Fortran interface is very similar to that of C. The names of
various routines are different to accommodate the various type
differences, e.g.\ \texttt{shmem\_integer\_put()} instead of
\texttt{shmem\_int\_put()}.

The biggest difference is in the symmetric memory management routines.
These have completely different names and parameters compared to the C
interface.

The \openshmem implementation handles Fortran with a very thin wrapper
on top of C. Mostly this involves catching Fortran's pass-by-reference
variables and dereferencing them in the underlying C call.

The main development has been on a CentOS platform with GNU
4.1.2-redhat.  There seem to be some issues with this compilers'
handling of cray-pointers: even the simplest programs (no \openshmem
content at all) produce a segmentation fault. Later versions
(e.g.\ 4.5.0 ++) behave better.

\section{Undefined Behavior}

Many routines are currently specified only in terms of ``correct''
behavior. What happens when something goes wrong is not always
specified.  This section attempts to set out a few of these scenarios
\begin{itemize}
\item put to PE out of range: suppose we do a put to ``right
neighbor'' (pe + 1). The highest-numbered PE will attempt to
communicate with a PE that does not exist.
\item library not initialized: virtually all \openshmem routines will
have major problems if the library has not been
initialized. Implementations can handle this situation in different
ways.
\end{itemize}

\section{Configuration and Installation}

There is a top-level \texttt{configure} script that is a simplified
version of the GNU autotools. This script will eventually become the
GNU setup and will do lots more feature tests. So the usual procedure
applies:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ /path/to/source/configure [--options...]
$ make
$ make install
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{configure} script accepts a
% make sure we get a real double-dash
\texttt{-{}-help} option that lists all the various settings.  Note
that you can run \texttt{configure} from a separate build directory,
or directly in the source tree.

\section{Environment Variables\label{sec:Environment-Variables}}

The behavior of the \openshmem library can be controlled via a number
of environment variables. For SGI compatibility reasons, we support
the ``SMA'' variables and our own new ones.

\subsection{SGI Environment Variables}

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SMA\_VERSION}}

Print the library version at start-up.

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SMA\_INFO}}

Print helpful text about all these environment variables.

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SMA\_SYMMETRIC\_SIZE}}

Number of bytes to allocate for symmetric heap.

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SMA\_DEBUG}}

Enable debugging messages.

\subsection{Reference Implementation Variables}

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SHMEM\_LOG\_LEVELS}}

A comma, space, or semi-colon separated list of logging/trace
facilities to enable debugging messages. The facilities currently
include the case-insensitive names:

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
    \hline
    \texttt{FATAL} & something unrecoverable happened, abort \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \hline
    \texttt{DEBUG} & used for debugging purposes \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{INFO} & something interesting happened \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{VERSION} & show this library version \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{SYMBOLS} & to inspect the symbol table information \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \hline
    \texttt{INIT} & set-up of the program \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{FINALIZE} & tear-down of the program \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{ATOMIC} & remote atomic operations \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{AUTH} & when something is attempted but not allowed \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{BARRIER} & about barrier operations \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{BROADCAST} & about broadcast operation \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{REDUCTION} & about reduction operations \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{CACHE} & cache flushing operations \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{COLLECT} & about collect and fcollect operation \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{QUIET} & tracing network quiet events \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{FENCE} & tracing network fence events \tabularnewline
    \hline

    \hline
    \texttt{SERVICE} & related to the network service thread \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{PROFILING} & for the PSHMEM profiling interface \tabularnewline
    \hline
    \texttt{MODULES} & loadable routines \tabularnewline
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SHMEM\_LOG\_FILE}}

A filename to which to write log messages.  All PEs append to this
file. The default is for all PEs to write to standard error. (Per-PE
log files might be an interesting addition.)

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SHMEM\_SYMMETRIC\_HEAP\_SIZE}}

The number of bytes to allocate for the symmetric heap area. Can scale
units ($2^n$) with ``K'' (kibi), ``M'' (mebi) etc. modifiers. The default is 2G.

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SHMEM\_BARRIER\_ALGORITHM}}

The version of the barrier to use. The default is ``naive''. Designed
to allow people to plug other variants in easily and test.

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SHMEM\_BARRIER\_ALL\_ALGORITHM}}

As for \texttt{SHMEM\_BARRIER\_ALGORITHM}, but separating these two
allows us to optimize if e.g.\ hardware has special support for global
barriers.

\subsubsection*{\texttt{SHMEM\_PE\_ACCESSIBLE\_TIMEOUT}}

The number of seconds to wait for PEs to reply to accessiblity
checks. The default is 1.0 (i.e\ may be fractional).

\section{Alternate collective algorithms}

A module sytem coupled with the above environment variables allows for
runtime decisions to be made about which algorithm should be used for
different collective routines

\subsection{Writing a New Collective Algorithm}

To add a new implementation of a broadcast, barrier or collect, the
following steps are required:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add a source file to the appropriate directory
\item write the 32- and 64-bit routines
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
An outline file is:

\vspace{0.1in}
\begin{minipage}{0.75\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C,caption={Outline of broadcast implementation}]
#include <...>

void
shmemi_broadcast32_clever (...)
{
  ...
}

void
shmemi_broadcast64_clever (...)
{
  ...
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{0.1in}

``shmemi\_'' is the internal implementation namespace.

The names of the new routines are added to the ``impl.h'' file in the
sub-directory, and the loader file in the collective's sub-directory
is configured to understand the new name and to assign the function
pointers accordingly.

\section{Compiling and Running Programs}

The SGI SHMEM is provided as part of the Message-Passing Toolkit (MPT)
in the
\href{http://www.sgi.com/products/software/propack.html}{ProPack}
suite. Compilation uses a standard C, C++ or Fortran compiler
(e.g.\ GNU, Intel) and links against the SMA and MPI libraries.

In order to abstract the compilation and launching process for
\openshmem we have provided 4 wrapper programs.  There is no
requirement to provide anything like this, it's merely a convenience.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{oshcc}: for compiling and linking C programs.
\item \texttt{oshc++/oshcxx}: for compiling and linking C++ programs.
\item \texttt{oshfort}: for compiling and linking F77/F90 programs.
\item \texttt{oshrun}: to launch programs.
\end{enumerate}

The similarity to the style of wrappers found in many MPI
implementations is obvious and intentional. Currently these wrappers
do handle a few situations (e.g.\ oshcc/CC and oshfort detect that they
shouldn't do linking and stop the underlying compiler complaining
about link options being present, but unused). The compiler scripts
are generated from a common template.

The run wrapper currently detects which GASNet conduit is being used
and sets up the environment accordingly to launch the program
\footnote{Not sure if this is the best place to do this check, or if
  the build process should work this out in advance to streamline the
  installed code.}.

\subsection{pkg-config}

An interface to pkg-config has also been added: the package name is
``openshmem''.  So you can compile and link separately e.g.\ with

\begin{lstlisting}
$ gcc $(pkg-config --cflags openshmem) program.c $(pkg-config --libs openshmem)
\end{lstlisting}

The pkgconfig file can be found in \emph{installroot/lib/pkgconfig}.

\section{Future Plans}

Ideas for extensions to SHMEM to go into \openshmem need to be
requested and evaluated from the SHMEM user and vendor community. A
decision process will determine which ideas are eventually
implemented. The library that this document refers to is hopefully a
good platform for these developments.

A number of extensions have already been proposed, and in fact have
been implemented in other SHMEM libraries. These include (but are not
limited to)

\begin{itemize}
\item thread-safety: providing thread-safe SHMEM routines that can
operate in threaded environments, e.g.\ alongside OpenMP;
\item non-blocking puts: put routines that return per-communication
handles to the caller. The handles can be tested later for completion
(present in Cray and Quadrics SHMEMs); this extension may require
revamping the way implicit handles are used in GASNet, since we will
be generating calls with explicitly generated handles. Building a
handle pool on which to synchronize later should take care of this.
\item locality: exposing information about topology to the library
and/or its API;
\item Fortran module, C++ API: provide better language support.
\end{itemize}
